# ABSTRACT

Fill in abstract... Write this last, after finishing methods, results, and discussion. Summarize the overall study question, approach, results, and conclusion in a short paragraph.

# BACKGROUND

Fireflies are one of the most intriguing insect species, admired for their mesmerizing bio luminescent dispay. Fireflies are often an indicator of the summer season, but the time of their peak abundance may be changing. As climate change alters temperature patterns across the region, it is possible that fireflies are emerging and peaking earlier than in previous years.

Recent temperature data shows a consistent trend of increasing temperatures in June than in previous years in the state of Utah.
Previous research has found that climate conditions have a small, yet significant effect on firefly abundance (Evans et al., 2019). Building on this idea, our study investigates firefly peak abundance has changed in timing at all due to the pattern of rising temperatures in Utah.

We will be using data from a publicly available citizen data set in Utah to further explore this question. These fiefly observations alongside temperature trend data across the past several years will allow us to determine whether fireflies are peaking due to climate related environmental changes.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  
Is firefly peak abundance occuring sooner than in years past due to climate change?

## Hypothesis 
Firefly population counts are larger earlier in the year than in prior years due to climate change.
  
## Prediction
Fill in here... Turn the hypothesis into a testable prediction (e.g., Locations with mosquito blood meals from house finches will also have higher numbers of WNV-positive mosquito pools).

# METHODS

Fill in here... Summarize the procedures and analyses you use in this report. In this section, describe what you did and why. Don’t just restate the code — explain the logic of each analysis in plain language. Keep each subsection short (2–4 sentences).

## 1st Analysis
Multiplot
```{r}
data <- read.csv("UtahFireflies - Revised.csv")

ggplot(data, aes(x= Month))+
  geom_bar(fill = "yellow3") +
  facet_grid(~ Year) +
  labs(title = "Number of Instances by Month and Year", 
       x = "Month", 
       y = "Number of Instances") +
  theme_minimal()

```

Fill in here... Explain that you compared the number of mosquito blood meals from each host species between sites with no WNV-positive pools and sites with one or more WNV-positive pools. Describe why a barplot helps visualize this comparison.

## 2nd Analysis
Scatter Plot
```{r}
#make plot of Max Julian day
table_Julian <- table(data$Year, data$Julian)
#find the max count each year
max_col <- apply(table_Julian, 1, which.max) 
# create a data frame with year and max julian day
numb_Julian <- as.numeric(colnames(table_Julian)[max_col])
numb_year <- c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
#plot as scatter plot
plot(numb_year, numb_Julian, main = "Peak Firefly Observation Counts", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Julian")
```
Fill in here... Explain that you tested whether the presence or number of house finch blood meals predicts whether a site had higher WNV positivity rate in tested mosquito pools. Mention that this statistical test lets you formally evaluate the relationship suggested by the barplots.

## 3rd Analysis
ANOVA Test
```{r}
#create data frame 
Julian_dataframe <- data.frame(ColumnA = numb_Julian, ColumnB = numb_year)
m1 <- lm( ColumnA ~ ColumnB, data=Julian_dataframe)
# run anova test for p value
anova(m1)
summary(m1)
```
# DISCUSSION

Fill in here... For each analysis, summarize what you found and interpret the results. Say whether they support or contradict your hypothesis.

## Interpretation of 1st analysis (e.g. barplots)

The first analysis... fill in here what it was, the summary of the results, and your interpretation. 

## Interpretation of 2nd analysis (e.g. generalized linear model)

The second analysis... fill in here what it was, the summary of the results, and your interpretation.

## Optional interpretation of 3rd analysis (e.g. heatmaps)

The third analysis... fill in here what it was, the summary of the results, and your interpretation.

# CONCLUSION

Fill in here... State the overall answer to your research question, based on all analyses. Mention whether the evidence supports your hypothesis and what it suggests about WNV amplification in Salt Lake City.
